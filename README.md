## Project Description
The objective of this project is to create a completely analog circuit (without microcontrollers) capable of monitoring heart rate using sensors and microcontroller technology. The system detects the pulse, processes the signal, and displays the heart rate on a screen.

## Methodology
1. **Sensor Integration**: Connected gel electrodes to capture the pulse.
2. **Signal Processing**: Used analog and digital signal processing techniques to clean and amplify the signal.
3. **Display Module**: Integrated a display module to show the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM).
4. **Testing and Calibration**: Tested the circuit under various conditions and calibrated it for accurate readings.

## Results
The heart rate monitoring circuit was able to accurately measure heart rates and display them in real-time. The testing phase confirmed the reliability and precision of the system under different scenarios.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the design and implementation of a heart rate monitoring circuit. The system's accuracy and real-time monitoring capabilities make it suitable for health monitoring applications.
